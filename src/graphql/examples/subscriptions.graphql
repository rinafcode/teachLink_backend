# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================

# To test subscriptions in GraphQL Playground:
# 1. Open a new tab in the playground
# 2. Paste one of the subscription queries above
# 3. Click the "Play" button
# 4. The subscription will stay active and listen for events
# 5. In another tab, execute a mutation that triggers the event
# 6. Watch the subscription tab receive real-time updates

# Example workflow:
# Tab 1: Run "OnCourseCreated" subscription
# Tab 2: Run "CreateCourse" mutation
# Tab 1: Will receive the newly created course data in real-time

# WebSocket connection is required for subscriptions
# Default endpoint: ws://localhost:3000/graphql
